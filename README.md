# Note List Terminal App

## Idea/Description
The Note List app is a simple yet powerful app for storing notes that you wrote
in external files and you can read back the notes in the terminal anytime with
ease.

## Plan
1. Draft a blueprint for the app we are building
2. Think about some basic functionalities of the app
3. Put the idea together and make a prototype with complete functionalities
4. Start writing code for the prototype app
5. Run and test the app to find potential bugs
6. Fix as many bugs as we can find
7. Refactor the source code and customisation for user experience
8. Continuous development, such as adding new features and bug fixes in the future

## Design


## Approach
To use the app, make sure `notelist_app.rb` and `notelist_class.rb` is in the
same folder. Before running the app, make sure to install the following gems:
```
gem install terminal-table
gem install colorize
```
